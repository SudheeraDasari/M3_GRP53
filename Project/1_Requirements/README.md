## Abstract:

Remote keyless entry (RKE) has captivated automobile buyers, as evidenced by the popularity of RKE on new automobiles and as an after-market item. This application note provides an overview of RKE systems and discusses how they meet requirements such as range, battery life, reliability, cost, and regulatory compliance. It shows some circuits and design approaches and offers some predictions for future systems, which will include two-way communications.

## Introduction 

Remote keyless entry (RKE) is an electronic access system that can be controlled from a distance. RKEs, which are typically used to remotely lock or unlock doors, require the end user to initiate an action that will cause a physical or software key fob to transmit a radio signal to a receiver that controls an electronic lock. Typically, the action is to press a button on a physical fob.Remote keyless entry, which is commonly used to protect vehicles from theft, can be contrasted with passive keyless entry (PKE), which does not require any action on the part of the end user. 


## 4W's And 1H
# WHAT
 A Remote keyless system controls the vehicle without using a traditional mechanical key.We can remotely access a car.
 # WHY
 RKE Systems are used for locking and unlocking a vehicle's doors by controlling the remote.
 # WHERE
 It is used for car owners where they can make the task self without unecesserly inserting the key.
 # WHEN
 It is used for cars as there is a chance of thefts.This can be used for locking and locking of doors of a car.
 # WHO
 RKE Systems are used by car users which are developed by automative engineers.So they must offer low cost and high reliability.
 # HOW
 There are functions on a key knob which are used for automatic door locking and unlocking for a car.
