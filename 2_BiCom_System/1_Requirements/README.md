## Description
This Project is an BiCom System,and is designed to remotely know the statuS of your automobiles, BiCom System operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency Bidirectionally.As we know RKE system which is only unidirectional but here the BiCom system is  bidirectional.

## Introduction

This is similar to RKE which is used for locking and unlocking but it is ubidirectional whereas BiCom System operates in bidirectional which operates by radio waves in a particular frequency. The BiCom System functionality differs from RKE system.It is the extension of the undirectional RKE System.

## Identifying Features
* It will prints window status when user pressed button once.
* It will show alarm status when user pressed button twice.
* It will show car battery information when user presssed button three times.
* It will show the status of Door when user pressed button four times

## High Level Requirements


| ID | High Level Requirement |
|----|------------------------|
|HLR1| It will prints window status when user pressed button once.|
|HLR2|It will show alarm status when user pressed button twice|
|HLR3|It will show car battery information when user presssed button three times.|
|HLE4|  It will show the status of Door when user pressed button four times|

## Low Level Requirements
| ID | Low  Level Requirement |
|----|------------------------|
|LLR1|When prints status of window,all the leds ON at same time|
|LLR2| When prints alarm status,all the leds OFF at same time|
|LLR3|When it will show battery information, all led on in clockwise manner|
|LLR4|When it shows the status of door,all the leds ON in anti-clockwise manner|

# Strength
* Less human interaction.
* Control the car remotely by checking the status of window,battery,door.
* Avoiding the chance of thefts.
 

# Weakness
* Next command will be in processes after completion of previous command.
* There may be problem with locking and unlocking when the distance is beyond threshold.

# Oppurnities
* This type of systems are mainly used for the cars.
 
# Threats
* The key fob doesnot work consistently.
* There may be chance of hacking.\

# WHAT
A BiCom system controls the vehicle without using a traditional mechanical key.We can remotely access a car.

# WHY
BiCom Systems are used for locking and unlocking a vehicle's doors by controlling the remote.

# WHERE
It is used for car owners where they can make the task self without unecesserly inserting the key.

# WHEN
It is used for cars as there is a chance of thefts.This can be used for locking and locking of doors of a car.

# WHO
BiCom Systems are used by car users which are developed by automative engineers.So they must offer low cost and high reliability.

# HOW
There are functions on a key knob which are used for automatic door locking and unlocking for a car.
